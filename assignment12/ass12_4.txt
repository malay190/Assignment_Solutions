Q.4- What is a difference between library and API . Figure it out with examples.

API:
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you’re using an API.

Imagine you’re sitting at a table in a restaurant with a menu of choices to order from. The kitchen is the part of the “system” that will prepare your order. What is missing is the critical link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table. That’s where the waiter or API comes in. The waiter is the messenger – or API – that takes your request or order and tells the kitchen – the system – what to do. Then the waiter delivers the response back to you; in this case, it is the food.

LIBRARY:

A library is a collection of code built to perform common tasks. Library code tends to be relatively stable and bug free. Use of appropriate libraries can reduce the amount of code the need to be written. It will tend to reduce line of code counts for an application will increasing the rate at which functionality is delivered. In most cases, it is better to use a library routine than to write your own code.
